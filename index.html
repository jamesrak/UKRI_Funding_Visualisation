            <h1>What is UKRI</h1>
            <p>The United Kingdom Research and Innovation (UKRI) is a non-departmental public body of the UK government,
                responsible for funding research and innovation across a wide range of disciplines. UKRI operates across
                the whole of the UK with a combined budget of more than £7 billion, bringing together the seven Research
                Councils, Innovate UK, and Research England.</p>

            <p>UKRI plays a significant role in urban regeneration by supporting research and innovation projects that
                aim to rejuvenate urban areas, drive economic growth, and enhance the quality of life for citizens.
                Through funding initiatives, UKRI encourages collaborations between academia, industry, and government
                to address urban challenges and develop sustainable solutions.</p>

            <p>Through its funding, UKRI has been a driving force behind many successful urban regeneration projects,
                enabling the revitalization of urban areas, the creation of new jobs, and the advancement of
                cutting-edge research and technology. It remains committed to supporting innovative projects that can
                transform urban living and contribute to a sustainable future.

                                Interestingly, the University College London not only leads in the number of
                                projects,
                                but also in the total amount of funding received. This suggests that they might

                                involved in more costly, large-scale projects. It's also noteworthy that the
                                distribution of funds isn't
                                strictly proportional to the number of projects, indicating that different

                                    products, and services that have the potential to disrupt existing markets and

                                Materials & Mobility' are the most explored research areas, accounting for more

                                Here, we see a significant shift. While 'Disruptive Technology' had the highest

                                of projects, it does not receive the most funding. Instead, 'Manufacturing,

                                technologies may be numerous, they might be less capital-intensive than projects
